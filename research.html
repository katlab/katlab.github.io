    <h3>Identifying novel enzymes through functional screens and proteomics</h3>
    
    We use activity based probes and proteomics to identify ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like enzymes across different
    developmental stages. We use biochemical and structural biology approaches to characterise activity and specificity.

    <h3>Unraveling the role of post-translational modifications in parasite cell biology
    </h3>
    We use parasite transgenics to disrupt and tag novel enzymes. Identifying new proteins and functionally
    characterising
    them. We aim to understand how these enzymes are used by the parasites and how ubiquitin and other
    post-translational
    modifiers regulate pathways critical to development and survival of these pathogens.

    <h3>Discovery of novel therapeutics</h3>
    Many of the pathways and enzymes we study are essential for parasite survival. We use a variety of methods to
    develop
    inhibitors including biophysical approaches, small molecule screens and peptide discovery. We aim is to interfere
    with
    parasite development and identify new classes of therapeutics to combat parasitic diseases and offset the
    ever-increasing threat of drug resistance.
